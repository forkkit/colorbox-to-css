# ColorBox to CSS
A small web app to convert your sweet [colorbox.io](http://colorbox.io) JSON color palette into CSS variables for use directly in your project.

## What is ColorBox?
ColorBox ([colorbox.io](http://colorbox.io)) is a color tool created by the design team at Lyft as part of their journey into the color space. You can read their full story [here](https://design.lyft.com/re-approaching-color-9e604ba22c88).

## Why should I use this?
ColorBox makes it easy to build a beautiful color palette, but doesn't make it easy to use those colors in your web project. This tool bridges the gap by allowing you to convert the export from ColorBox directly into CSS variables.

## How does ColorBox to CSS work?
Build your color palette on colorbox.io, then
1. Go to [Colorbox to CSS](https://colorboxtocss.dev)
2. Choose a variable prefix
3. Paste your Hex JSON color palette
4. Copy CSS variables into your project!
